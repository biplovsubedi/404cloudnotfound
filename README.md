Sample Code for 404 Cloud Not Found Team

Lambda handler available in main.py in lib folder.

Google Maps data is  retrieved using Google Maps API key. Since this is a private key, and uploading it in github public repo raises an alert, it has been removed from the file.

Please supply your personal Google Maps API key in lib.googleroutes.py (variable -- GMAPS_API_KEY)

Leaving it blank raises an error.
